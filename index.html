                                        Traffic offences such as speeding, red light violations, and dangerous driving

                                        In recent years, targeted initiatives and traffic camera systems have been
                                        deployed to monitor and reduce such offences.</p>

                                        fines and enforcement measures have evolved to improve road safety. With an

                                        during peak periods, such as holidays, indicating a link between driver
                                        behaviour and safety risks, with speeding offences particularly prevalent in
                                        non-school zones, necessitating targeted enforcement. While a correlation exists
                                        between increased violations and higher accident risks, the ACT records
                                        relatively fewer accidents, possibly due to its smaller population and land

                                        , underlining the importance of promoting responsible driving behaviours. To
                                        combat high-risk activities like speeding, the ACT government is implementing
                                        stricter penalties, community education programs, and reinvesting fine revenues
                                        into road safety initiatives, reflecting a proactive commitment to fostering a
                                        safer driving environment for all Australians. For more information, check the
