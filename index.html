                                        <p>Road safety in the <b>Australian Capital Territory (ACT)</b> is a key concern for both local authorities and residents. 
                                        Traffic offences such as speeding, red light violations, and dangerous driving significantly impact public safety. 
                                        In recent years, targeted initiatives and traffic camera systems have been deployed to monitor and reduce such offences.</p>
                                        <p>This data visualisation explores trends in <b>traffic offences</b> and the associated penalties, shedding light on how 
                                        fines and enforcement measures have evolved to improve road safety. With an emphasis on data collected from various locations across the ACT, 
                                        this study examines the impact of these measures on reducing violations and promoting safer driving habits.</p>

                                        <p>There is a noticeable disparity in penalty amounts between different regions. The eastern states tend to have higher penalties compared to the western and northern territories. This difference can be linked to factors such as higher population density, increased traffic volume, and stricter enforcement strategies. The eastern part of the country, which includes major cities like Sydney and Brisbane, is more densely populated and frequently visited (<a href="https://www.johnmason.com/blog/moving-to-australia-east-west-or-south-coast/">source by John Mason</a>). Additionally, road rules for learner ('L') and provisional ('P') drivers are generally consistent when traveling between the ACT and NSW (<a href="https://www.police.act.gov.au/road-safety/act-learner-and-provisional-drivers">source by ACT police</a>), contributing to NSW having the highest distribution of penalties per capita during this period.</p>

                                    <div class="col-md-4">
                                        <p>There is a steady increase in penalty amounts per capita in the ACT over the years. This rise is linked to a growing number of drivers detected for speeding and drug use, trends that have been recorded since 2008 (<a href="https://www.drive.com.au/news/police-traffic-infringement-data-reveals-road-safety-worrying-trends/">source by Drive Australia</a>). Increased enforcement efforts, particularly around speeding and drug-related offences, have contributed to the rise in fines. Nationally, eastern states like New South Wales tend to have higher penalties due to factors such as population density and traffic volume, while Western and Northern territories see lower penalties.</p>

                                <p class="mt-4 text-justify">"Other Persons" accounts for the highest number of offences, with the flow being significantly larger for almost every type of violation. This categoryâ€™s dominant presence in the Sankey diagram shows that non-government and non-diplomatic organizations contribute disproportionately to the overall offence count. A disproportionate number of traffic offences committed by the "Other Persons" category particularly for speeding violations in non-school zones (<= 15 km/h over the limit) are captured predominantly by fixed and mobile speed cameras. This aligns with broader research suggesting that speeding remains one of the most frequent traffic infringements in Australia, especially in areas monitored by automated enforcement devices such as speed cameras (<a href="https://www.trafficlawyersperthwide.com.au/blog/what-is-the-most-common-traffic-offence-in-australia/">source by Traffic Lawyers Perth</a>).</p>

However, the ACT Legislative Assembly inquiry recommended waiving some of the speeding fines incurred during this period, especially for those who faced financial hardship . This decision, along with increased public awareness and better communication about the new speed limits, likely contributed to a reduction in traffic infringements in the following months and years. Additionally, the government's efforts to improve road safety by expanding the 40 kilometers per hour speed limit areas and implementing the ACT Road Safety Action Plan may have led to better compliance with traffic regulations. As a result, the number of traffic infringements in ACT dropped from 20,493 in July 2021 to 7,096 after July 2021, reflecting the positive impact of these measures on road safety and driver behavior.</p>
