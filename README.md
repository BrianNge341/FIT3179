# Road Safety in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) - Analysis Based on Traffic Offences

## Project Overview

This project explores road safety trends in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) by analyzing traffic offences and the penalties associated with them. The analysis uses traffic camera offence data from the ACT Government and highlights how these offences, such as speeding and red-light violations, have impacted road safety over time.

The data visualizations created for this project include interactive choropleth maps, sankey diagrams, and line charts that provide insights into traffic penalties, trends across states, and the effectiveness of enforcement measures. The project aims to showcase the correlation between traffic violations, population density, and the volume of traffic across different regions in Australia.

## Objectives

- To provide an analysis of traffic offences in the ACT and across Australia.
- To explore the trends in penalties and how they vary by region and offence type.
- To evaluate the impact of traffic safety measures, such as speed limits, on road safety in the ACT.
- To offer insights into the effectiveness of enforcement measures like traffic cameras in reducing offences.
- To analyze the role of interstate drivers in contributing to traffic offences in the ACT.

## Datasets

1. **ACT Traffic Dataset**  
   This dataset contains information on traffic camera offences and fines from the ACT Government, covering data from July 2010 to December 2022.  
   Dataset URL: [ACT Traffic Dataset](https://www.data.act.gov.au/Transport/Traffic-camera-offences-and-fines/2sx9-4wg7/about_data)

2. **Australia Population Dataset**  
   This dataset from the Australian Bureau of Statistics provides population data for each state and territory in Australia.

## Visualization Details

1. **Choropleth Maps**
   - Visualizes the penalty amounts (AUD) per capita and per vehicle across various states in Australia.
   - Highlights regional disparities, with eastern states showing higher penalties due to higher population density and traffic volume.
   
2. **Sankey Diagrams**
   - Displays the flow of traffic offences categorized by offence type and offender type, such as "Other Persons."
   - Reveals key offence types like speeding and red-light violations, and highlights how different categories contribute to the overall violation count.

3. **Line Charts**
   - Shows trends in traffic infringements over time, particularly focusing on how changes in speed limits in Canberraâ€™s city center impacted the number of violations.
   - Analyzes the role of interstate drivers in contributing to traffic offences in the ACT.

## Key Insights

- **Penalty Disparities Across Regions**: Eastern states like New South Wales have higher penalty amounts due to factors like higher population density, stricter enforcement measures, and greater traffic volumes.
- **Increase in ACT Penalties**: The ACT saw a significant rise in penalties per capita, mainly due to an increase in speeding and drug-related offences, reflecting intensified enforcement efforts.
- **Impact of Speed Limit Changes**: The introduction of lower speed limits in Canberra led to an initial increase in traffic infringements, but subsequent public awareness and fine waivers contributed to a decrease in offences.
- **Role of Interstate Drivers**: Drivers from New South Wales contribute significantly to the overall amount of fines in the ACT, particularly during peak periods such as holidays.

## How to Use the Visualization

The visualizations in this project are interactive and designed to provide detailed insights. Below are the steps to explore each visualization:

1. **Choropleth Maps**:
   - Hover over each state to see the penalty amount per capita or per vehicle for that region.
   - Use the dropdown menus to filter by state and year for a more targeted view of the data.

2. **Sankey Diagrams**:
   - Click on specific sections to see how traffic offences flow between categories (e.g., offence type and offender type).
   - Hover over the flows to get detailed counts of each offence type.

3. **Line Charts**:
   - Explore traffic infringement trends over time by selecting different states and years.
   - Analyze how specific events, like speed limit changes, impacted the number of offences.

## Dependencies

- **Vega-Lite**: For building the interactive visualizations.

## Conclusion

The analysis of road safety in the ACT highlights the importance of enforcement measures like traffic cameras and speed limits in reducing traffic offences. While penalties have increased in recent years, particularly in eastern states, targeted interventions and public awareness campaigns have proven effective in promoting safer driving behaviors. This project offers valuable insights into the relationship between traffic violations and road safety across Australia.
